### Go Proverbs

- Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.
- Concurrency is not parallelism.
- Channels orchestrate; mutexes serialize.
- The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction.
- Make the zero value useful.
- `interface{}` says nothing.
- Gofmt's style is no one's favorite, yet gofmt is everyone's favorite.
- A little copying is better than a little dependency.
- Syscall must always be guarded with build tags.
- Cgo must always be guarded with build tags.
- Cgo is not Go.
- With the unsafe package there are no guarantees.
- Clear is better than clever.
- Reflection is never clear.
- Errors are values.
- Don't just check errors, handle them gracefully.
- Design the architecture, name the components, document the details.
- Documentation is for users.
- Don't panic.

### The Zen of Go

- Each package fulfils a single purpose
- Handle errors explicitly
- Return early rather than nesting deeply
- Leave concurrency to the caller
- Before you launch a goroutine, know when it will stop
- Avoid package level state
- Simplicity matters
- Write tests to lock in the behaviour of your package’s API
- If you think it’s slow, first prove it with a benchmark
- Moderation is a virtue
- Maintainability counts

### Code

#### Always `go fmt` your code.

Community uses the official Go format, do not reinvent the wheel.

Try to reduce code entropy. This will help everyone to make code easy to read.

#### Multiple if-else statements can be collapsed into a switch

```go
// NOT BAD
if foo() {
    // ...
} else if bar == baz {
    // ...
} else {
    // ...
}

// BETTER
switch {
case foo():
    // ...
case bar == baz:
    // ...
default:
    // ...
}
```

#### To pass a signal prefer `chan struct{}` instead of `chan bool`.

When you see a definition of `chan bool` in a structure, sometimes it's not that easy to understand how this value will be used, example:
```go
type Service struct {
    deleteCh chan bool // what does this bool mean? 
}
```

But we can make it more clear by changing it to `chan struct{}` which explicitly says: we do not care about value (it's always a `struct{}`), we care about an event that might occur, example:
```go
type Service struct {
    deleteCh chan struct{} // ok, if event than delete something.
}
```

#### Prefer `30 * time.Second` instead of `time.Duration(30) * time.Second`

You don't need to wrap untyped const in a type, compiler will figure it out. Also prefer to move const to the first place:
```go
// BAD
delay := time.Second * 60 * 24 * 60

// VERY BAD
delay := 60 * time.Second * 60 * 24

// GOOD
delay := 24 * 60 * 60 * time.Second
```

#### Use `time.Duration` instead of `int64` + variable name

```go
// BAD
var delayMillis int64 = 15000

// GOOD
var delay time.Duration = 15 * time.Second
```

#### Group `const` declarations by type and `var` by logic and/or type

```go
// BAD
const (
    foo = 1
    bar = 2
    message = "warn message"
)

// MOSTLY BAD
const foo = 1
const bar = 2
const message = "warn message"

// GOOD
const (
    foo = 1
    bar = 2
)

const message = "warn message"
```

This pattern works for `var` too.

- [ ] every blocking or IO function call should be cancelable or at least timeoutable
- [ ] implement `Stringer` interface for integers const values
  - https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer
- [ ] check your defer's error

```go
  defer func() {
      err := ocp.Close()
      if err != nil {
          rerr = err
      }
  }()
```

- [ ] don't use `checkErr` function which panics or does `os.Exit`
- [ ] use panic only in very specific situations, you have to handle error
- [ ] don't use alias for enums 'cause this breaks type safety
  - https://play.golang.org/p/MGbeDwtXN3

```go
  package main
  type Status = int
  type Format = int // remove `=` to have type safety

  const A Status = 1
  const B Format = 1

  func main() {
	println(A == B)
  }
```

- [ ] if you're going to omit returning params, do it explicitly
  - so prefer this ` _ = f()` to this `f()`
- [ ] the short form for slice initialization is `a := []T{}`
- [ ] iterate over array or slice using range loop
  -  instead of `for i := 3; i < 7; i++ {...}` prefer `for _, c := range a[3:7] {...}`
- [ ] use backquote(\`) for multiline strings
- [ ] skip unused param with _

```go
  func f(a int, _ string) {}
```

- [ ] If you are comparing timestamps, use `time.Before` or `time.After`. Don't use `time.Sub` to get a duration and then check its value.
- [ ] always pass context as a first param to a func with a `ctx` name
- [ ] few params of the same type can be defined in a short way

```go
  func f(a int, b int, s string, p string)
```

```go
  func f(a, b int, s, p string)
```

- [ ] the zero value of a slice is nil
  - https://play.golang.org/p/pNT0d_Bunq
  ```go
    var s []int
    fmt.Println(s, len(s), cap(s))
    if s == nil {
      fmt.Println("nil!")
    }
    // Output:
    // [] 0 0
    // nil!
  ```
  - https://play.golang.org/p/meTInNyxtk

```go
  var a []string
  b := []string{}

  fmt.Println(reflect.DeepEqual(a, []string{}))
  fmt.Println(reflect.DeepEqual(b, []string{}))
  // Output:
  // false
  // true
```

- [ ] do not compare enum types with `<`, `>`, `<=` and `>=`
  - use explicit values, don't do this:

```go
  value := reflect.ValueOf(object)
  kind := value.Kind()
  if kind >= reflect.Chan && kind <= reflect.Slice {
    // ...
  }
```

- [ ] use `%+v` to print data with sufficient details
- [ ] be careful with empty struct `struct{}`, see issue: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/23440
  - more: https://play.golang.org/p/9C0puRUstrP

```go
  func f1() {
    var a, b struct{}
    print(&a, "\n", &b, "\n") // Prints same address
    fmt.Println(&a == &b)     // Comparison returns false
  }

  func f2() {
    var a, b struct{}
    fmt.Printf("%p\n%p\n", &a, &b) // Again, same address
    fmt.Println(&a == &b)          // ...but the comparison returns true
  }
```

- [ ] wrap errors with http://github.com/pkg/errors
  - so: `errors.Wrap(err, "additional message to a given error")`
- [ ] be careful with `range` in Go:
  - `for i := range a` and `for i, v := range &a` doesn't make a copy of `a`
  - but `for i, v := range a` does
  - more: https://play.golang.org/p/4b181zkB1O
- [ ] reading nonexistent key from map will not panic
  - `value := map["no_key"]` will be zero value
  - `value, ok := map["no_key"]` is much better
- [ ] do not use raw params for file operation
  - instead of an octal parameter like `os.MkdirAll(root, 0700)`
  - use predefined constants of this type `os.FileMode`
- [ ] don't forget to specify a type for `iota`
  - https://play.golang.org/p/mZZdMaI92cI

```go
  const (
    _ = iota
    testvar         // will be int
  )
```

  vs

```go
  type myType int
  const (
    _ myType = iota
    testvar         // will be myType
  )
```

#### Don’t use `encoding/gob` on structs you don’t own.

At some point structure may change and you might miss this. As a result this might cause a hard to find bug.

#### Don't depend on the evaluation order, especially in a return statement.

```go
// BAD
return res, json.Unmarshal(b, &res)

// GOOD
err := json.Unmarshal(b, &res)
return res, err
```

#### To prevent structs comparison add an empty field of `func` type

```go
type Point struct {
	_ [0]func()	// unexported, zero-width non-comparable field
	X, Y float64
}
```

#### Prefer `http.HandlerFunc` over `http.Handler`

To use the 1st one you just need a func, for the 2nd you need a type.

#### Move `defer` to the top

This improves code readability and makes clear what will be invoked at the end of a function.

#### JavaScript parses integers as floats and your int64 might overflow.

Use `json:"id,string"` instead.

```go
type Request struct {
	ID int64 `json:"id,string"`
}
```

### Concurrency
- [ ] best candidate to make something once in a thread-safe way is `sync.Once`
  - don't use flags, mutexes, channels or atomics
- [ ] to block forever use `select{}`, omit channels, waiting for a signal
- [ ] don't close in-channel, this is a responsibility of it's creator
  - writing to a closed channel will cause a panic
- [ ] `func NewSource(seed int64) Source` in `math/rand` is not concurrency-safe. The default `lockedSource` is concurrency-safe, see issue: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/3611
  - more: https://golang.org/pkg/math/rand/
- [ ] when you need an atomic value of a custom type use [atomic.Value](https://godoc.org/sync/atomic#Value)

### Performance
- [ ] do not omit `defer`
  - 200ns speedup is negligible in most cases
- [ ] always close http body aka `defer r.Body.Close()`
  - unless you need leaked goroutine
- [ ] filtering without allocating

```go
    b := a[:0]
    for _, x := range a {
    	if f(x) {
		    b = append(b, x)
    	}
    }
```

#### To help compiler to remove bound checks see this pattern `_ = b[7]`

- [ ] `time.Time` has pointer field `time.Location` and this is bad for go GC
  - it's relevant only for big number of `time.Time`, use timestamp instead
- [ ] prefer `regexp.MustCompile` instead of `regexp.Compile`
  - in most cases your regex is immutable, so init it in `func init`
- [ ] do not overuse `fmt.Sprintf` in your hot path. It is costly due to maintaining the buffer pool and dynamic dispatches for interfaces.
  - if you are doing `fmt.Sprintf("%s%s", var1, var2)`, consider simple string concatenation.
  - if you are doing `fmt.Sprintf("%x", var)`, consider using `hex.EncodeToString` or `strconv.FormatInt(var, 16)`
- [ ] always discard body e.g. `io.Copy(ioutil.Discard, resp.Body)` if you don't use it
  - HTTP client's Transport will not reuse connections unless the body is read to completion and closed

```go
    res, _ := client.Do(req)
    io.Copy(ioutil.Discard, res.Body)
    defer res.Body.Close()
```

- [ ] don't use defer in a loop or you'll get a small memory leak
  - 'cause defers will grow your stack without the reason
- [ ] don't forget to stop ticker, unless you need a leaked channel

```go
  ticker := time.NewTicker(1 * time.Second)
  defer ticker.Stop()
```

- [ ] use custom marshaler to speed up marshaling
  - but before using it - profile! ex: https://play.golang.org/p/SEm9Hvsi0r

```go
  func (entry Entry) MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error) {
	buffer := bytes.NewBufferString("{")
	first := true
	for key, value := range entry {
		jsonValue, err := json.Marshal(value)
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		if !first {
			buffer.WriteString(",")
		}
		first = false
		buffer.WriteString(key + ":" + string(jsonValue))
	}
	buffer.WriteString("}")
	return buffer.Bytes(), nil
  }
```

- [ ] `sync.Map` isn't a silver bullet, do not use it without a strong reasons
  - more: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/sync/map.go#L12
- [ ] storing non-pointer values in `sync.Pool` allocates memory
  - more: https://github.com/dominikh/go-tools/blob/master/cmd/staticcheck/docs/checks/SA6002

- [ ] to hide a pointer from escape analysis you might carefully(!!!) use this func:
  - source: https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/86976

```go
  // noescape hides a pointer from escape analysis.  noescape is
  // the identity function but escape analysis doesn't think the
  // output depends on the input. noescape is inlined and currently
  // compiles down to zero instructions.
  func noescape(p unsafe.Pointer) unsafe.Pointer {
  	x := uintptr(p)
  	return unsafe.Pointer(x ^ 0)
  }
```

- [ ] for fastest atomic swap you might use this
  `m := (*map[int]int)(atomic.LoadPointer(&ptr))`
- [ ] use buffered I/O if you do many sequential reads or writes
  - to reduce number of syscalls
- [ ] there are 2 ways to clear a map:
  - reuse map memory
```go
	for k := range m {
		delete(m, k)
	}
```

  - allocate new

```go
	m = make(map[int]int)
```

### Modules
- [ ] if you want to test that `go.mod` (and `go.sum`) is up to date in CI
  https://blog.urth.org/2019/08/13/testing-go-mod-tidiness-in-ci/

### Build
- [ ] strip your binaries with this command `go build -ldflags="-s -w" ...`
- [ ] easy way to split test into different builds
  - use `// +build integration` and run them with `go test -v --tags integration .`
- [ ] tiniest Go docker image
  - https://twitter.com/bbrodriges/status/873414658178396160
  - `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -ldflags="-s -w" app.go && tar C app | docker import - myimage:latest`
- [ ] run `go format` on CI and compare diff
  - this will ensure that everything was generated and committed
- [ ] to run Travis-CI with the latest Go use `travis 1`
  - see more: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build/blob/master/public/version-aliases/go.json
- [ ] check if there are mistakes in code formatting `diff -u <(echo -n) <(gofmt -d .)`

### Testing
- [ ] prefer `package_test` name for tests, rather than `package`
- [ ] `go test -short` allows to reduce set of tests to be runned

```go
  func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
    if testing.Short() {
      t.Skip("skipping test in short mode.")
    }
  }
```

- [ ] skip test depending on architecture

```go
  if runtime.GOARM == "arm" {
    t.Skip("this doesn't work under ARM")
  }
```

- [ ] track your allocations with `testing.AllocsPerRun`
  - https://godoc.org/testing#AllocsPerRun
- [ ] run your benchmarks multiple times, to get rid of noise
  - `go test -test.bench=. -count=20`

### Tools
- [ ] quick replace `gofmt -w -l -r "panic(err) -> log.Error(err)" .`
- [ ] `go list` allows to find all direct and transitive dependencies
  - `go list -f '{{ .Imports }}' package`
  - `go list -f '{{ .Deps }}' package`
- [ ] for fast benchmark comparison we've a `benchstat` tool
  - https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/perf/cmd/benchstat
- [ ] [go-critic](https://github.com/go-critic/go-critic) linter enforces several advices from this document
- [ ] `go mod why -m <module>` tells us why a particular module is in the `go.mod` file
- [ ] `GOGC=off go build ...` should speed up your builds [source](https://twitter.com/mvdan_/status/1107579946501853191)
- [ ] The memory profiler records one allocation every 512Kbytes. You can increase the rate via the `GODEBUG` environment variable to see more details in your profile.

### Misc
- [ ] dump goroutines https://stackoverflow.com/a/27398062/433041

```go
  go func() {
    sigs := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
    signal.Notify(sigs, syscall.SIGQUIT)
    buf := make([]byte, 1<<20)
    for {
      <-sigs
      stacklen := runtime.Stack(buf, true)
      log.Printf("=== received SIGQUIT ===\n*** goroutine dump...\n%s\n*** end\n", buf[:stacklen])
    }
  }()
```

- [ ] check interface implementation during compilation
  ```go
  var _ io.Reader = (*MyFastReader)(nil)
  ```
- [ ] if a param of len is nil then it's zero
  - https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/#len
- [ ] anonymous structs are cool

```go
  var hits struct {
    sync.Mutex
    n int
  }
  hits.Lock()
  hits.n++
  hits.Unlock()
```

- [ ] `httputil.DumpRequest` is very useful thing, don't create your own
  - https://godoc.org/net/http/httputil#DumpRequest
- [ ] to get call stack we've `runtime.Caller` https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#Caller
- [ ] to marshal arbitrary JSON you can marshal to `map[string]interface{}{}`
- [ ] configure your `CDPATH` so you can do `cd github.com/golang/go` from any directore
  - add this line to your `bashrc`(or analogue) `export CDPATH=$CDPATH:$GOPATH/src`
- [ ] simple random element from a slice
  - `[]string{"one", "two", "three"}[rand.Intn(3)]`
